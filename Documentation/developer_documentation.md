# Developer documentation

This documentation explains how to contribute to the project and how to use the software in more detail. If you haven't read the [README.md](../README.md) file or the [user documentation](user_documentation.md), please do so first.

## Project structure
The project is split into 5 main parts (it uses camel case for folders and snake case for files):
- `App` - the web application, that allows you to interact with the robot
- `Documentation` - the developer and the user documentation of the project
- `DataManagement` - helper scripts for data management
- `Function` - different modules controlling the robot
- `Training` - scripts for training AI models used in the project

### Web app
The app currently gives you access to a console, via which you can interact with the robot [command_manager.py](../Web/Controls/command_manager.py). It uses the flask library at the moment.
