# Vision

## Introduction
This is an experiment to create a human-like agent using artificial intelligence.
With the current rise of language models, it is now possible to use them as a brain for an agent.
It is also possible to process audio and visual input and extract valuable information from it which
can be later combined with the brain itself.

As the available technology improves and new research is done, I want to continuously update the robot,
so it will eventually match state-of-the-art performance.
