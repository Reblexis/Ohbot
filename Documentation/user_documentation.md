## Console
After running the app via `App/main.py` and successfully connecting to the robot, you will be presented with a console. 
The console allows you to enter individual commands with which you can experiment with the different functions of the robot. 
Each command may have its own parameters. Use can use the command `help` to get a list of all available commands and their parameters. 
If you type `help <command>` you will get a more detailed description of the command and its parameters.
