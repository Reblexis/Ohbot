# TARS (Thoughtful Artificially intelligent and Responsive System)
The goal of this project is to develop a human-like robot using artificial intelligence. This software is being developed for a mechanical robot head, which
can rotate, blink, move its mouth and rotate its eyes. The robot is controlled by arduino-like microcontroller.

## Installation
In order to be able to use the software, you will need to have the robot. The robot is available from [https://www.ohbot.co.uk/store/p22/OhbotAssembled.html](https://www.ohbot.co.uk/store/p22/OhbotAssembled.html).
If you already have the robot available, you can clone this repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The recommended Python version is 3.9 or higher.

## Running the software
Right now, the software can be tested via running the developed console by launching script `App/main.py`. Please note, that the software is still under development and therefore, may not work as expected.
Please report any issues you encounter.

## Documentation
If you'd like to contribute to the project or want to learn more about the usage, you can find more detailed documentation in the `Documentation` folder.
